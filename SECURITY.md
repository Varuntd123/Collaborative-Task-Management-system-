# Security Guide - Collaborative Task Management System

## 🔒 Security Overview
This document outlines security best practices and configurations for the Collaborative Task Management System.

## 🚨 Critical Security Measures

### 1. Database Security
- **Never commit real credentials** to version control
- Use environment variables for database connections
- Implement strong password policies
- Limit database user permissions
- Enable SSL connections in production

### 2. JWT Security
- **Change default JWT secret** in production
- Use environment variables for JWT configuration
- Implement proper token expiration
- Validate JWT tokens on all protected endpoints

### 3. API Security
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all input data
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Add request logging for security monitoring

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file (never commit this) with:
```bash
# Database
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_password

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
JWT_EXPIRATION=86400000

# Server
SERVER_PORT=8080
```

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Use strong JWT secrets
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Database backup encryption

## 🛡️ Security Headers
The application includes security headers for:
- XSS Protection
- Content Security Policy

- HSTS (in production)

## 📝 Security Logging
- All authentication attempts are logged
- Failed login attempts are tracked
- API access is monitored
- Database queries are logged (configurable)

## 🔍 Security Testing
- Use the provided Postman collection
- Test all role-based access controls
- Verify input validation
- Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Test authentication flows

## 📞 Security Contact
